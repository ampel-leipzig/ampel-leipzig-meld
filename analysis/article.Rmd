# Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is the terminal result of fibrotic remodeling
of liver tissue due to chronic damage. An organ failure is often
irreversible and the only available therapy is liver transplantation.
However, the shortage in grafts for transplantation from deceased donors
requires risk stratification and precise allocation rules.
The allocation of liver transplantation in most countries is based on
disease severity determined by the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD)
[@malinchoc2000; @wiesner2003; @optn_policies2021].
The MELD score estimates the patients' 3-month mortality risk based on
laboratory results, namely bilirubin, creatinine and international normalized
ratio (INR). In general the MELD score is extended by the sodium level
(MELD-Na score) as this was found to be an important additional risk factor in
liver cirrhosis [@kim2008; @optn_policies2021].
The MELD was initially developed for predicting the survival of patients
undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.
Afterwards it was revalidated for predicting mortality risk in patients awaiting
a liver transplantation.
Although the MELD score should be an objective allocation score especially the
creatinine and INR are highly dependent on the utilized laboratory methods
[@trotter2004; @cholongitas2007]. Patients with identical disease state could
have very different MELD scores and thus get different priority on the liver
transplantation waiting list.
Furthermore often, e.g. for acute-on-chronic liver failure, the MELD score
underestimates the mortality risk [@hernaez2020].

There have been some attempts to use the data extracted from more than 300.000
electronic medical records from two hospitals in the United States to improve
the MELD score [@kartoun2017]. The derived MELD-Plus7 and MELD-Plus9 risk score
add albumin, white blood cell count, age and total cholesterol and length of
stay to the MELD-Na variables. Despite its published prediction improvement the
MELD-Plus scores are not used for transplant allocation yet.

As depicted by MELD-Plus risk scores better predictive scores often need more
variables and are more complicated. To reduce the risk of overlooking or
incorrectly calculating and interpreting the results,
clinical decision support systems may be used and could improve patient safety.
The research project on digital laboratory medicine (AMPEL) develops a
clinical decision support system based on laboratory diagnostics that should
support clinical practitioners in interpreting the laboratory results and taking
the necessary medical interventions [@eckelt2020].

This study aims to find clinical and laboratory values that improve the risk
stratification for liver transplantation over classical MELD, MELD-Na and
MELD-Plus scores and could be implemented as part of the AMPEL clinical decision
support system.
